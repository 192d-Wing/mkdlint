# Getting Started

## Installation

Use `npm install my-package` or visit https://example.com/very/long/url/that/would/normally/trigger/the/line/length/rule/but/does/not.

## Usage
No blank line before this heading.

### Step 1

Run the command.

Step 2
------

Mixed heading style: this setext heading after ATX headings triggers MD003 consistent violation.

#### Deeply nested

Jump from H2 to H4 skips a level.

## Examples

Bare URL: https://github.com/example/repo should not fire because MD034 is disabled.

Another bare URL: http://example.org/docs also safe in github preset.
